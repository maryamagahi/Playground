Featuring Python Notebooks from the analyses conducted by Maryam Agahi.

## EDA_FoodHub_Data_Analysis
In this project I used the data from a company named FoodHub (similar to Doordash and UberEats) to analyze the demand for different restaurants and identify ways to enhance customer experience. 
### Challenges in the analysis process:
* Determining when to perform in-depth analyses versus when to maintain a higher-level overview
* Conducting univariate and bivariate analyses for all critical fields and their combinations was time-consuming. 
* Incorporating business acumen is crucial for guiding data scientists in focusing on relevant factors. 
### What would you do differently in future?
* I would Invest more time upfront to carefully plan the analysis in a strategic and efficient approach. 
* Creating template notebooks for common analyses can streamline the process and improve efficiency.
