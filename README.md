## Project 1. EDA_FoodHub
* **Project Description:** The data from a company named FoodHub (similar to Doordash and UberEats) to analyze the demand for different restaurants and identify ways to enhance customer experience.
*  **Challenges:**
    * Determining when to perform in-depth analyses versus when to maintain a higher-level overview
    * Conducting univariate and bivariate analyses for all critical fields and their combinations was time-consuming.
    * Incorporating business acumen is crucial for guiding data scientists in focusing on relevant factors.
*  **Improvement Opportunities:**
    * I would Invest more time upfront to carefully plan the analysis in a strategic and efficient approach.
    * Creating template notebooks for common analyses can streamline the process and improve efficiency.
